##Logging

1. If you include date format in the log, it must be sortable. ISO-8601, ISO-3339 or a zero-padded timestamp. No exceptions.
2. Always include filename and line number where possible. Makes it a lot easier to jump to parts of the project and set breakpoints. The format {filename}:{lineno}:message
3.If a function returns something, try to avoid putting log statements in its body. Keep it as close to being a pure function as you can; logging is a side effect that could break the function if something breaks in logging.
4.Donâ€™t log irrelevant details
